Welcome to my submission for the Three.js challenge! This project features a vending machine placed in a field of grass, where you can interact with the machine by clicking on it. Each correctly entered code will increase your score, and your final score determines the number of prizes you'll receive from the machine.

## Demo:

## Special Thanks
James Smyth: A special thanks to James Smyth for his insightful article on Breathe of the Wild Style grass in Three.js. I adapted his shader for the grass in a separate component in React Three Fiber (r3f) to make it easily reusable. Check out his work at [smythdesign.com](https://www.smythdesign.com).
